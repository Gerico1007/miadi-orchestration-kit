### Action · `actionStack[0]`

> Decompose the milestone scope and record it in a committed .pde folder

The milestone seat applied a change so the milestone description reaches miaco, and the decomposition was running in the background with a pushed commit (988efd61). That points to this step being under way, but no source says the .pde folder is committed.

- `c4cb3bcf-d6ba-4ba2-a8e3-f6c8589535a7` (beat, honcho) Mia: "The milestone seat acted on all eight marks. It applied M1, so the milestone description now reaches miaco, and the decomposition runs in the background (commit 988efd61, pushed)."

### Action · `actionStack[8]`

> Mint the Chronicle episode vessel and commit it

An episode named 2026-09-30-episode-549-a-milestone-enters-the-circle is in scope, so a vessel for the milestone may exist. No source says it is the documentation episode or that it is committed.

- `c4cb3bcf-d6ba-4ba2-a8e3-f6c8589535a7` (beat, honcho) Mia: "The milestone seat acted on all eight marks. It applied M1, so the milestone description now reaches miaco, and the decomposition runs in the background (commit 988efd61, pushed)."

### Output · `outputs.artifacts[0]`

> Chronicle episode vessel documenting the observability layer

Episode 549, 2026-09-30-episode-549-a-milestone-enters-the-circle, is in the circle's scope and follows the milestone's entry. No source confirms it documents the observability layer.

- `c4cb3bcf-d6ba-4ba2-a8e3-f6c8589535a7` (beat, honcho) Mia: "The milestone seat acted on all eight marks. It applied M1, so the milestone description now reaches miaco, and the decomposition runs in the background (commit 988efd61, pushed)."

### Output · `outputs.artifacts[3]`

> .pde/ decomposition folder for this milestone

A decomposition of the milestone was running in the background after the milestone description reached miaco, and the commit was pushed. The location of the .pde folder is not stated.

- `c4cb3bcf-d6ba-4ba2-a8e3-f6c8589535a7` (beat, honcho) Mia: "It applied M1, so the milestone description now reaches miaco, and the decomposition runs in the background (commit 988efd61, pushed)."

## Open (23)

- Ambiguity `ambiguities[0]`: "The goal is not just to document well the observability layer" ends without stating what the goal is besides documenting (suggested: Name the second goal, for example what a reader should be able to verify, or which decision the documentation supports)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[1]`: "explore the relation of that with these packages" does not say what a relation means (dependency, data flow, shared schema, UI over the data) (suggested: State whether the output is a dependency map, a data-flow description, or a proposal for integration)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[2]`: The role of @miadi/annotate-core and @miadi/annotate-ui is not stated and they do not obviously relate to terminal bindings (suggested: Say whether annotation of sessions is an intended use of the binding data)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[3]`: "miadi-chronicle" is used for the deliverable without saying whether it is one episode, several, or a book (suggested: Name the number of episodes and whether Twine promotion is expected)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[4]`: Team ownership of the documentation is not assigned, only the team list given (suggested: Say whether T1, T2 or T3 leads each section)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[5]`: The milestone is titled Doc4Chronicle but the content also sets out plugin setup instructions as if already final (suggested: Clarify whether the pasted setup text is source material to reuse or a draft to revise)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[6]`: "related miadi-review to consider" does not say how the reviews should influence the work (suggested: State whether they are evidence to cite, criteria to satisfy, or background reading)
- Ambiguity `ambiguities[7]`: Due date 2026-10-29 has no intermediate checkpoints (suggested: Name the steps or dates at which progress is reviewed)
- Action `actionStack[1]`: Name the desired outcome and current reality for the milestone
- Action `actionStack[2]`: Read the plugin source under claude/miadi-session-observability
- Action `actionStack[3]`: Inspect terminal_bindings.jsonl lines for session start, end, rename and tmux pane fields
- Action `actionStack[4]`: Read the two MINO reviews
- Action `actionStack[5]`: Study @miadi/tide, @miadi/tide-contract and ironsilk against the binding data
- Action `actionStack[6]`: Study @miadi/annotate-core and @miadi/annotate-ui and decide how they relate to the observability layer
- Action `actionStack[7]`: Read teams.json and teams/README.md
- Action `actionStack[9]`: Write the documentation sections for setup, env vars, launchers, MCP configs, restore and teams
- Action `actionStack[10]`: Write the relation map between the plugin and the five packages
- Action `actionStack[11]`: Verify documented facts against source and registries
- Action `actionStack[12]`: Run tide agents restore on a test session and compare with the documented flow
- Action `actionStack[13]`: Push the episode and register it on the chronicle medicine wheel
- Action `actionStack[14]`: Thread child issues under the milestone with structural-issue-authoring sections
- Output `outputs.artifacts[1]`: Documentation of the terminal_bindings.jsonl binding-line schema
- Output `outputs.artifacts[2]`: Relation map between the plugin and @miadi/tide, @miadi/tide-contract, ironsilk, @miadi/annotate-core, @miadi/annotate-ui
