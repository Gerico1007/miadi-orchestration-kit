# miadi-operator-desk

The operator desk (T7 in `teams/README.md`) as a Claude Code plugin. William asks how a part of the factory works, such as a tool's commands, tmux, which team a session is on, or where a practice lives. The desk answers from the owning team's text, checked against the tool, and keeps the question.

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jgwill/miadi-orchestration-kit
claude plugin install miadi-operator-desk@miadi-orchestration-kit
```

## What it holds

| part | what it does |
|---|---|
| skill `operator-desk` | Answers a question from the owning team's text, checks it against the tool and records it. Sends a question the docs or tools could not answer to the team that owns them, and turns a question that comes back into a pointer in the skill. |
| command `/desk-record` | Writes the conversation's questions to the ledger, makes the handoffs, grows the skill, commits and pushes. |
| `desk/ledger.jsonl` | One line per question: William's words, the answer, its sources, the owning team, whether it was a gap, and the handoff. |

The plugin has no hooks and no MCP server.

## Where the ledger is written

The skill writes to the kit checkout at `$MIADI_ORCHESTRATION_KIT_ROOT/claude/miadi-operator-desk/desk/ledger.jsonl`, never to the installed copy, which an update replaces. It stops when `MIADI_ORCHESTRATION_KIT_ROOT` is not set.
